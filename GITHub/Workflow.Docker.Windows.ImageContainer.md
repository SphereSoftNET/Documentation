# Workflow using Windows Docker Image/Container



## [Description of GITHub workflow file](#)

Using a Windows Docker Image/Container at GITHub workflow actions is not direct
supported. But GITHub runners have a Docker installation, so Windows Docker Images
can be used and managed. One disadvantage this has - acting on Docker needs mostly
between 15 to more than 30 minutes, so have patience.

To use a Windows Runner you need to use the `runs-on` directive in your `job`.
GITHub supports `windows-2019` and `windows-2022`. So you can use images based
on Micosoft Windows images with `LTSC` of `2019` and `2022`.

The following sample uses a GITHub standard template for workflow. Here we
configure a Runner `windows-2019` for the official Microsoft .NET Framework SDK 4.8
image on Windows Server Core 2019 LTSC ([mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/sdk:4.8-windowsservercore-ltsc2019](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-framework-sdk/)).

After standard checkout from GITHub we need the related environment variables
which we store in a temporary file for use with docker. The next step is then
the docker run it self. We start them interactive, take sure you use `-i` instead
of `-it` which some times to see. Additional we want remove the running container
after our run, so we use `--rm`. With `--env-file` we load the original environment
from the temporary file into our docker environment. `C:\TEMP` directory will be
used for exchange of data between the Runner and the Docker container. GITHub
Runner checking the project out to drive `D:`. Docker doesn't support a mapping
of Windows drives into an image (also not with the VOLUME directive). So we use
a workaround. First mapping the `D:` drive into the sub directory `C:\TEMP\_DriveD`
of our Docker container. Inside the container we map sub directory `C:\TEMP\_DriveD`
back to drive `D:` with the `subst` command. At last we can start a powershell
direct command or a command file as argument to the `-Command` call of powershell.

As result from the workflow run you will see a section `Copy environment for Docker`
with the forwarded environment. In another section `Run at docker` you will find
the result of `dir D:\` command and the output from the direct command for powershell -
the content of enviroment variables `GITHUB_REF`, `GITHUB_REF_NAME`, `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`
and `RUNNER_WORKSPACE`.

```yaml

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '**'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
